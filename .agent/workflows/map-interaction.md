description: instructions for interacting with the map canvas during testing
---

When testing the map canvas, follow these interaction rules:
1. **Scrolling**: To move the map, use a click-and-drag motion. Specifically, click and drag upwards to "scroll" or move the map up. Standard mouse wheel or touch scroll functionality is NOT the primary way to move the map viewport.
2. **Node Interaction**: Click on hexagonal nodes to interact with them (view encounters, etc.).
3. **Zooming**: Use standard zoom controls if available, but for movement, always refer to the click-and-drag method.
